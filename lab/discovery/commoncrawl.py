"""Every public job board Common Crawl has seen, as candidates for the central scout.

Guessing feed addresses from company names finds a few a day. Common Crawl (a free, public web archive) keeps an index of every address it
crawled: asking it for `jobs.ashbyhq.com/*`, `*.teamtailor.com` and the like lists the boards that exist (one crawl held 1,924 Ashby boards
when the index had 121). Each board's address names the job system and its slug, so the scout probes it with one request.

Runs inside the central scout (central-scout.yml), from a checkout of the public engine: `python ops/discovery/commoncrawl.py --db data/jobs.sqlite`.
A crawl is read once (its id is remembered in scout_meta); a new crawl appears about monthly. Polite: one request at a time, a pause between them,
the index's own paging. Nothing about any user is involved.
